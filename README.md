Discusion: \
I assumed that using next.js would be similar to how I've used React before, but it took some getting used to the \
layout that it uses. \
Tried to keep things as modular as possible, but had some trouble modularising the page turning buttoms. \
I'm particularly proud of the automatic colour picker for each pokemon.\
It had also been quite a long time since I had use React so I had to get used to using state variables and things \
like that again but overall I found the process to be quite enjoyable actually.
