Assumptions: \
I assumed that using next.js would be similar to how I've \
used React before, but it took some getting used to the \
layout that next uses. \
Tried to keep things as modular as possible, but had some trouble \
modularising the page turning buttoms. \
It had also been quite a long time since I had use React \
so I had to get used to using state variables and things \
like that again.
